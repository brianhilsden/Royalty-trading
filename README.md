# Phase 1 Project
#### Date: 12/April/2024

## Description  
Online trading website that only works for Moringa students. It needs sign-up and login authentication with moringa email address before granting access.Hence non Moringa students cannot trade there .
Buyers can contact the previous seller in case of any issues. I came up with the idea to build an app that Moringa students can trust. It also helps in promoting their business ventures. 
Available features include:
 - Register account
 - Sign in to account
 - Log out
 - Add products to be sold
 - View available products that you don't own
 - Purchase products
 - View owned products
 - Edit and save product details
 - Remove product from market

More features are in the works to make the website even more effective
