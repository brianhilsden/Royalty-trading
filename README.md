## Description  
Online trading website that only works for Moringa students. It needs sign-up and login authentication with moringa email address before granting access.Hence non Moringa students cannot trade there .
Buyers can contact the previous seller in case of any issues. I came up with the idea to build an app that Moringa students can trust. It also helps in promoting their business ventures. 
Available features include:
 - Register account
 - Sign in to account
 - Reset password
 - Log out
 - Add new products to be sold
 - View available products
 - Search for products
 - Purchase products
 - View owned products
 - Edit and save product details
 - Remove product from market
 - Contact previous owner in case of any issues
More features are in the works to make the website even more effective
